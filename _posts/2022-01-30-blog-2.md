In this blog post, I'll create a simple webapp using Flask and describe how I did it. 

The app built in this blog post later is a simple message bank, which allows:

1. the user to submit messages to the bank.

2. the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.

In addition, to make the app look better and more readable, I'll use CSS for the app development.

The code for this app is hosted in a Github repository at https://github.com/JiyuanLyu/pic-flask. 

# 1. Enable Submissions

In this part, I'll use Flask fundamentals skills.

First of all, create a `submit` template with three user interface elements:
1. A text box for submitting a message.
2. A text box for submitting the name of the user.
3. A “submit” button.

To do this, I put navigation links inside a template called `base.html` and then use the template `submit.html` to extend `base.html`.

```
# Create the base.html template
# The base.html is shown below


<!doctype html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
# Edit the title fo the webapp
<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} - Jiyuan's Message Bank</title>
<nav>
  <h1>Jiyuan's First Webapp!</h1>
  <!-- <b>Navigation:</b> -->
  <ul>
    # Edit the navigation link for user to submit messages
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">Submit your message</a></li>
    # Edit the navigation link for user to view messages
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('view') }}">View messages</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<section class="content">
  <header>
    {% block header %}{% endblock %}
  </header>
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</section>
```

Then, I wrote the `submit.html` and `view.html` templates extending `base.html`.

```
# Create the submit.html template
# to extend the base.html


{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}Submit{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <form method="post">
      # The instruction for user to type in their messages
      <label for="message">Please type your message here:</label>
      <input name="message" id="message">
      <br>
      # The instruction for user to leave their names
      <label for="name">Your name or handle:</label>
      <input name="name" id="name">
      <br>
      # The button to submit message
      <input type="submit" value="Submit message">
  </form>
  {% if thanks %}
    # The notification after users submit their messages
    Thanks! You just submit a message!
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

The basic home page of the webapp is set up. 
Now, I'll write two Python functions for database management for my message bank.
