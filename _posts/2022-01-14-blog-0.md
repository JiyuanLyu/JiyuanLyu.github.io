In this post, I'll show that how to construct a great visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

First of all, import the dataset as `penguins`.

```
# Here import the package pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load the url link of the table
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"

# Save the link as a pandas table
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Then, import the `seaborn` package to plot a scatterplot of the `Culmen Length (mm)` and `Culmen Depth (mm)` for different species. 

```
# Here import the package seaborn
import seaborn as sns

# Create the plot with corresponding variables group by species
fgrid = sns.relplot(x = 'Culmen Length (mm)', 
                    y = 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 
                    hue = 'Species', 
                    data = penguins)
fgrid.axes[0][0].semilogx()
```
Label the scatterplot appropriately. 

```
# Label title, x-axis and y-axis of the plot
labels = fgrid.axes[0][0].set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', 
                              ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 
                              title  =
            'Figure 1: Culmen Length (mm) and Culmen Depth (mm) by Species')
```

A clear scatterplot is created!
