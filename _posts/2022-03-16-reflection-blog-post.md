In this blog, I'll discuss about my feedback about the exprience in completing the group project.

## Reflection

### Overall, what did you achieve in your project? 

In this project, my teammates and I serve a Diabete risk questionnaire in the WebApp and predict if the users have Diabetes with our statistical model. As a statisitcs student, I achieve to apply our knowledge in Statistics and Computer Science by combing the statistical model and creating a WebApp in Python. 

### What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 

I'm most proud that I applied my statistics knowledge to solve a real-life problem, which is to create an interactive WebApp and help people to evaluate their health status. Even though the model may still have some issues with the false-negative outcomes, it still achieves high accuracy in predicting the Diabetes status.

The other aspect is that we have accomplished all the goals in the proposal, which indicates we have already had a great understanding of programming in Python and applied our skills learned in this course. 

### What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.) 

First of all, since the model is completely based on the original dataset and is not time-sensitive, I think the model is not "learning" over time. I'll suggest collecting users' data with permission and asking about their official test results of Diabetes after they go to the hospital. And then we can add these data into our dataset, and keep our model learning.

On the other hand, I think we can improve the layout of our Web App to make it more readable and attractive. What's more, I would like to add more information about the Diabetes symptoms on the test result page for users to know. 

### How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)

Hooray! We have fully achieved all the goals in the proposal. There is only one difference between our setouts and the project outcome, which is that we wanted to display the questionnaire as a pop-up window and show one question separately. However, considering making the questionnaire clear, we show all the questions at once. 

### What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc? 

I learned my programming skill in Python. For example, how to build and use the database in Python, analyze data and build models with the Python packages.

Also, I got familiar with cooperative working on GitHub with my teammates. We finish our part separately and present together by committing to the master repository, 

Last but not least, I learned to use `css` to customize the layout of the website. And I have a better understanding of WebApp. 

### How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible. 

I think this experience will improve my programming skills in Python and soft skill in using GitHub, which is helpful for my future career. What's more, as a statistics student, I've been wondering about applying my professional knowledge in the real world, especially in the healthcare area. This project inspired me about what I can do and what I'd love to do as a data scientist in the future. I really appreciate this project assignment. 

## Special Thanks

At the end, I would like to thank my team members, Zhuofan Huang and Yiran Liu, who are so supportive and creative. Thanks to their contribution, we have achieved our goals in the proposal. And also I would like to thank Prof. Chodrow for his amazing lectures and assignment design. I learned and practiced all the skills in the materials by doing the assignment and project, and I really enjoyed the class!
