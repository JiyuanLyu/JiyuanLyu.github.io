In this Blog Post, I will use webscraping to answer the following question:

>What movie or TV shows share actors with my favorite movie <Harry Potter> ?

This post has two parts. In the first part, I'll write a webscraper to find shared actors on IMDB. In the second part, I'll use my webscraper to make recommendations.

# Part 1. Setup

## Locate the Starting IMDB Page

My favorite movie is **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**. Its IMDB page is at https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/.

# Webscraper

## `parse(self, response)`

```
def parse(self, response):
    """
    This function navigates to the `Cast & Crew` page
    from the starting movie page, and then calls the function
    `parse_full_credits(self, response)`.
    """

    # Navigates to the `Cast & Crew` page
    castcrew = response.urljoin("fullcredits")

    # Call function in the `callback` argument to 
    # a yielded `scrapy.Request`
    yield scrapy.Request(castcrew,
                         callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

## `parse_full_credits(self, response)`

```
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    """
    This function yield a `scrapy.Request` for the page of 
    each actor listed on the `Cast & Crew` page.
    Call the method `parse_actor_page(self_response)` when
    reaching the actors' pages.
    """

    # Click the actors' pictures using the hint
    actors = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
    # For each actor, yield a request
    for actor in actors:
        actor_page = "https://www.imdb.com/" + actor
        yield scrapy.Request(actor_page,
                             callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

## `parse_actor_page(self, response)`

```
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    """
    This function yield a dictionary of two key-value pairs as
    {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}
    from the page of the actor.
    """

    # Get the first value in the dictionary: actor_name
    actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()

    # Then, get the second value in the dictionary: movie_or_TV_name
    # Get all the filmography of this actor
    movies = response.css("div.filmo-row b a::text").getall()
    for movie_name in movies:
        # Here, to get rif of the trivial names,
        # I'll not include the show names with
        # "Episode" or "Show all"
        if (movie_name.find("Episode" and "Show all") == -1):
            yield {"actor": actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name": movie_name}
```
